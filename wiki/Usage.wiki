= Details =

The project is host by google appengine : http://sasarssfilter.appspot.com/rssfilter

The servlet had two parameter: 
 - feedUrl : the url of the feed you want to filter<br/>
 - filter : (multiple) field,value.
For the moment only title field is supported. But I can had more if you need.

Example:
http://sasarssfilter.appspot.com/rssfilter?feedUrl=http://www.lequipe.fr/rss/actu_rss_Auto-Moto.xml&filter=title,WRC

This url took the feed "http://www.lequipe.fr/rss/actu_rss_Auto-Moto.xml" and show only item's having WRC in there title
